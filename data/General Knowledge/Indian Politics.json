However, the Lok Sabha *alone* doesn't handle all of these responsibilities.  Instead, it works *together* with the Rajya Sabha (the upper house) to form the Parliament.  Together they participate in the: \n    1. Election of the President: Members of Parliament (both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) and members of the Legislative Assemblies of the States vote in the Presidential election.  \n    2. Election of the Vice President: Members of *both* houses of Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) elect the Vice President. \n    3. Removal of Judges:  Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts can be removed through a process called impeachment. This requires a special majority in *both* houses of Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha). \n\nWhy the other options are incorrect: \n    *Ministry of Defence (Option A):* This ministry is responsible for the defense of the country. It does not have a role in electing the President or Vice President, or removing judges. \n    *Prime Minister's Office (Option B):* This office provides support to the Prime Minister. It does not have a direct role in these electoral or impeachment processes. \n    *Securities and Exchange Board of India (Option D):* SEBI regulates the securities market. It has no involvement in electing constitutional functionaries or removing judges. \n\nIn Summary: While the Lok Sabha *works with* the Rajya Sabha (the other house of Parliament) for these functions, it is the most directly involved among the options provided. The other options have completely different roles in the government."

So this is less specific.\n\nOption B: Federal character of government: A federal system is specifically designed to divide power between a central government and states/regions. Also, an independent judiciary is vital in a federal system to resolve disputes between the different levels of government and to ensure that no level oversteps its constitutional boundaries.  This is a very strong fit.\n\nOption C: Socialist character of government: Socialism primarily focuses on economic and social equality and often involves government control or ownership of resources. It doesn't inherently guarantee a division of power or judicial independence.\n\nOption D: Unitary character of government: A unitary system is the opposite of federal. Power is centralized in one national government. This definitely doesn't fit.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is Option B: Federal character of government because division of power and an independent judiciary are core features of a federal system."
