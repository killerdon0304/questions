Precipitation is more likely to occur when the sky is overcast with clouds, as clouds contain water droplets or ice crystals that can fall as precipitation when they become heavy enough.\nOption B: Temperature of moisture in air suddenly increases\n\n    This option is not correct. An increase in temperature typically leads to the evaporation of moisture rather than precipitation.\nOption C: Temperature of moisture in air sharply decreases\n\n    This option is partly correct. Precipitation often occurs when the temperature of moist air decreases, causing the air to reach its dew point and water vapor to condense into liquid or ice, forming precipitation.\nOption D: Winds begin to blow in a circular motion\n\n    This option is not correct. The circular motion of winds is associated with weather phenomena like cyclones or hurricanes but is not the primary cause of precipitation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate options related to precipitation are a combination of Option A (The sky is overcast with clouds) and Option C (Temperature of moisture in air sharply decreases). Precipitation often occurs when the sky is cloudy and the temperature of moist air decreases, leading to condensation and the formation of precipitation."

        "note": "A cumulus cloud that exhibits significant vertical development (but is not yet a thunderstorm) is called cumulus congestus or towering cumulus. If enough atmospheric instability, moisture, and lift are present, then strong updrafts can develop in the cumulus cloud leading to a mature, deep cumulonimbus cloud, i.e., a thunderstorm producing heavy rain. In addition, cloud electrification occurs within cumulonimbus clouds due to many collisions between charged water droplet, graupel (ice-water mix), and ice crystal particles, resulting in lightning and thunder."

        "note": "Solar energy heats the earth’s surface. But the energy does not stay bound up in the earth’s environment forever. Instead, as the earth warms, it emits thermal radiation. This thermal radiation, which is largely in the form of long-wave infrared rays, eventually finds its way out into space, leaving the earth and allowing it to cool. However, not all of the infrared rays pass into space. Some of the infrared rays are absorbed by greenhouse gases and warm the atmosphere. So the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is directly related to the temperature of the atmosphere."

These cyclones form over warm ocean waters, where the sea surface temperatures are typically above 26.5°C (80°F), providing the necessary energy for their development. The warm and moist air near the ocean's surface rises and creates a spinning motion due to the Earth's rotation, leading to the formation of these cyclonic systems. As they move across the warm waters, tropical cyclones can intensify and become powerful storms. Therefore, they can develop and mature anywhere within the tropical zone."

A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center, a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, strong winds, and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain. Tropical cyclones originate entirely within the tropical air mass. Tropical cyclones are like giant engines that use warm, moist air as fuel. That is why they form only over warm ocean waters near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward from near the surface. Tropical cyclones are more destructive than the western disturbances. Tropical cyclones out at sea cause large waves, heavy rain, flood and high winds, disrupting international shipping and, at times, causing shipwrecks."

        "note": "Sub-tropical high pressure belt is dynamically induced and characterized with anti-cyclonic conditions. This is why this zone is characterized by anticyclonic con­ditions which cause atmospheric stability and aridity. The conver­gence of winds at higher altitude above this zone results in the subsidence of air from higher altitudes. Thus, descent of winds results in the contraction of their volume and ultimately causes high pressure. This is one of the reasons for the presence of hot deserts of the world in the western parts of the continents in a zone extending between 25°-35° in both the hemi­spheres. This zone of high pressure is called ‘horse latitude’ because of prevalence of frequent calms."
