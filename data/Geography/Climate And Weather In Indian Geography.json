        ],
        "correct_answer": "d",
        "note": "*   Orographic rainfall happens when moist air is forced to rise over natural barriers like mountains. As the air rises, it cools, and the moisture condenses to form clouds and rain. This is the main reason for heavy rainfall in areas like the Western Ghats and the Himalayas. \n*   Cyclonic rainfall is associated with cyclones. While India experiences cyclones, they don't account for the majority of the country's rainfall. \n*   Convectional rainfall occurs when the ground is heated, causing air to rise. This is more common in hotter regions, but not the primary source of India's overall rainfall. \n*   Elusive means difficult to find or catch, which doesn't relate to rainfall types. \n\nTherefore, since mountain ranges significantly influence rainfall patterns across large parts of India, orographic rainfall is the most accurate answer."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "note": "The monsoon is caused by the seasonal reversal of winds.\nDuring summer, landmasses tend to heat up more quickly than oceans, creating a low-pressure area over the land. Meanwhile, oceans retain their relatively cooler temperatures, creating a high-pressure area. This pressure gradient causes winds to blow from the ocean towards the land, bringing moisture-laden air. This is known as the summer monsoon.\nIn winter, the situation reverses. Landmasses cool down more rapidly than oceans, creating a high-pressure area over the land and a low-pressure area over the ocean. This reversal in pressure causes winds to blow from the land towards the ocean, leading to the winter monsoon.\n\nOption A: Temperature changes\nWhile temperature changes are a factor in monsoon dynamics, the primary cause of the monsoon is the seasonal reversal of winds, not just temperature changes.\n\nOption C: Humidity difference\nHumidity difference plays a role in the monsoon, but it's not the primary cause. The direction of the winds, influenced by pressure differences, is the key factor in the monsoon phenomenon.\n\nOption D: Pressure differences\nPressure differences indeed play a crucial role in causing monsoons. The seasonal reversal of winds is a result of pressure differences between landmasses and oceans, leading to the monsoon phenomenon.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: Seasonal reversal of winds."

The southwest monsoon winds bring moisture-laden air from the Arabian Sea to the Indian subcontinent. As this moist air encounters the Western Ghats, it is forced to rise, cool, and condense, leading to the formation of premonsoon showers.\n\nKerala and Karnataka are the states located along the western coast of India, adjacent to the Western Ghats. The geography of this region, with the presence of the Western Ghats, makes it conducive for the occurrence of these early rain showers before the onset of the full-fledged monsoon.
