This lithosphere is divided into tectonic plates, which float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere below.\n\nThe term 'Sima' stands for \"silica + magnesium,\" referring to the composition of the rocks in the Earth's crust and uppermost mantle. Silicates rich in magnesium are denser and heavier than those rich in other elements like aluminum. These heavier silicates, or 'Sima', are most abundant in the ocean floors, which are part of the Earth's crust.\n\nThe ocean floors are primarily composed of basaltic rocks, which are rich in magnesium and iron. These rocks make up the oceanic crust. Basalt is formed through volcanic activity at mid-ocean ridges and is a type of 'Sima' material.\n\nIn contrast, the continental crust is composed of lighter silicates known as 'Sial', which stands for \"silica + aluminum.\" These lighter silicates are less dense and make up the landmasses and continental areas.\n\nSo, the correct answer, 'Option D: Ocean floors', reflects the abundance of 'Sima' (silica + magnesium) in the composition of oceanic crust, making it the most suitable option."

The International Date Line is often positioned along the 180° meridian of longitude.\nStatement 2: It is determined by 180° longitude but is not a straight line.\nCorrect. This statement is accurate. The International Date Line is not a straight line due to adjustments made to avoid dividing land areas and nations.\nStatement 3: It is a Greenwich meridian helping in fixing time and date.\nIncorrect. The International Date Line is not a Greenwich meridian. It serves a distinct purpose of separating different calendar days.\nStatement 4: It solves the problem of time and date among the World's nations.\nCorrect. The International Date Line indeed helps address the challenge of coordinating time and date differences across the world, ensuring a systematic transition from one day to another.\n\nBased on the explanations provided, the correct options are E: 1, 2, and 4.
