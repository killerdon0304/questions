This makes it the highest river basin among the options.\n*   D: Narmada: The Narmada flows through a relatively lower elevation compared to Krishna's Deccan Plateau region.\n\nTherefore, the Krishna river basin is considered the highest because a large part of its basin lies on the elevated Deccan Plateau."
