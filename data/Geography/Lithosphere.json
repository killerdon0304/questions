        "note": "he intensity of earthquakes is measured on the Richter scale. Developed by Charles F. Richter in 1935, this scale quantifies the energy released by an earthquake. It is a logarithmic scale, meaning that each whole number increase represents a tenfold increase in amplitude of the seismic waves and approximately 31.6 times more energy release.\nThe Beaufort scale is used to measure wind speed and its effects on sea conditions, not earthquake intensity.\nThe Secant scale and Mercalli scale are used to measure earthquake intensity based on observed effects and damage, but they are not the primary scales for measuring earthquake magnitude.\nHence, the correct answer is Option B: Richter scale."

Igneous rocks are mostly crystalline in nature because they form from the solidification of molten material, allowing mineral crystals to grow and develop.\nIV. This statement is incorrect.

        "note": "P-wave, S-wave, L-wave is the proper order of seismic waves as they are received at seismograph station. The first kind of body wave is the P wave or primary wave. This is the fastest kind of seismic wave, and, consequently, the first to 'arrive' at a seismic station. The P wave can move through solid rock and fluids, like water or the liquid layers of the earth. It pushes and pulls the rock it moves through just like sound waves push and pull the air. The second type of body wave is the S wave or secondary wave, which is the second wave you feel in an earthquake. An S wave is slower than a P wave and can only move through solid rock, not through any liquid medium. The first kind of surface wave is called a Love wave, named after A.E.H. Love, a British mathematician who worked out the mathematical model for this kind of wave in 1911. It's the fastest surface wave and moves the ground from side-to-side."

Mid-Continental Belt is a large volcanically active region. Other terms are used for smaller areas of activity, such as volcanic fields. Volcanic belts are found above zones of unusually high temperature (700-1400 °C) where magma is created by partial melting of solid material in the Earth's crust and upper mantle. These areas usually form along tectonic plate boundaries at depths of 10–50 km. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) is a mid-ocean ridge, a divergent tectonic plate or constructive plate boundary located along the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, and part of the longest mountain range in the world."
