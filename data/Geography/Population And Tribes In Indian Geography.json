This shows that the number of scheduled caste individuals has increased. \n\nIn the rural areas, there are 15,38,50,562 scheduled caste members, accounting for 18.5% of the rural population. In the urban areas, there are 4,75,27,524 scheduled caste individuals, constituting 12.6% of the urban population. The scheduled caste population grew at a different rate in these two areas.

The scheduled caste population, however, had a higher growth rate of 20.8% during the same period. This difference can be attributed to the migration of scheduled caste individuals from villages to towns and cities. \n\nNow, let's examine the options:\nA) Jharkhand - In the 2011 census, the scheduled caste population in Jharkhand was 12.08%.\nB) Madhya Pradesh - According to the 2011 census, scheduled caste population in Madhya Pradesh is 15.62%.\nC) Punjab - In the 2011 census, Punjab had the highest scheduled caste population, which was 31.94%.\nD) Uttar Pradesh - According to the 2011 census, the scheduled caste population in Uttar Pradesh was 20.70%.\n\nSo, based on the data, the correct answer is Option ‘C’ (Punjab).\nSome additional information:\n    A census is a way of counting and collecting data about a population.\n    Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in India, with a population of 19.96 crores, according to the 2011 Census.\n    India's population in 2011 was 1,210,854,977, and it increased by 181.5 million people since 2001."
