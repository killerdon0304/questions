This phenomenon is known as synchronous rotation or tidal locking. As a result, Venus rotates on its axis very slowly and in the opposite direction compared to most other planets. It takes about 243 Earth days for Venus to complete one rotation on its axis, and it also takes about 225 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun. This means that a day (rotation) on Venus is longer than its year (revolution). Therefore, the correct answer is Option B, which is Venus."

At the age of 27, Kepler became the assistant of a wealthy astronomer, Tycho Brahe, who asked him to define the orbit of Mars. Brahe had collected a lifetime of astronomical observations, which, on his death, passed into Kepler’s hands. (Brahe, who had his own Earth-centered model of the Universe, withheld the bulk of his observations from Kepler at least in part because he did not want Kepler to use them to prove Copernican theory correct.) Using these observations, Kepler found that the orbits of the planets followed three laws."
