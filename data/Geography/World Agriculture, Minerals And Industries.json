A sudden rise in barometric reading heralds the approach of anticyclone\nWhich of these statements are correct?",

        ],
        "correct_answer": "d",
        "note": "1. \"The winds are divergent, and spiral out from the centre of high pressure\":\nThis statement is correct. Anticyclones are areas of high atmospheric pressure where the air descends from above. As the air descends, it spreads out horizontally, leading to divergent winds that spiral outwards from the center of high pressure.\n2. \"The air moves clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in Southern Hemisphere\":\nThis statement is incorrect. In the Northern Hemisphere, the air around an anticyclone moves clockwise, while in the Southern Hemisphere, it moves anticlockwise. This direction of movement is due to the Coriolis effect, which is a result of Earth's rotation.\n3. \"It is accompanied by heavy rainfall\":\nThis statement is incorrect. Anticyclones are generally associated with fair and dry weather conditions. The descending air in an anticyclone suppresses the upward movement of moist air, leading to clear skies and lower chances of precipitation.\n4. \"A sudden rise in barometric reading heralds the approach of anticyclone\":\nThis statement is correct. An anticyclone is often characterized by high atmospheric pressure at the surface. As an anticyclone approaches, the barometric (atmospheric pressure) reading tends to rise, indicating the presence of the high-pressure system.\n\nIn summary, anticyclones are areas of high pressure where air descends and spreads out, leading to divergent winds. The air movement is clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. Anticyclones are associated with fair and dry weather, and a sudden rise in barometric reading indicates their approach.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option A, which means only Statements 1 and 4 are correct regarding anticyclones."

Clouds form as water vapour condenses, and then fall as rain."
