However, the Government of India Act, 1935 played a significant role in shaping the administrative and constitutional framework of India, which eventually contributed to the events leading to the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan in 1947.\nThe Government of India Act, 1935, introduced a federal structure for British India, with the establishment of provinces and princely states as units. It granted substantial autonomy to provinces and introduced separate electorates for religious communities. These provisions, along with political tensions and communal divisions, laid the groundwork for the partition of India.\nOption A: The Government of India Act, 1909, also known as the Morley-Minto Reforms, introduced separate electorates for Muslims and other communities.\nOption B: The Government of India Act, 1919, also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, introduced limited provincial autonomy and increased representation for Indians in legislative bodies.\nOption D: The option \"None of these\" is not accurate since the Government of India Act, 1935, contributed to the circumstances that led to the partition of India.\nTherefore, the correct option is Option C: Government of India Act, 1935, which, although not directly ensuring partition, had significant implications for the events leading to the partition of India.\n**If you believe there is an error, please consult reliable historical sources for verification."

The Khilafat Movement was initiated to support the cause of the Ottoman Caliphate (Caliphate of Turkey) after the end of World War I.\nOption A: Mahatma Gandhi's decision to return the war medals was not directly related to the Jallianwala Bagh tragedy, which occurred in 1919.\nOption B: The Non-Cooperation Movement, initiated by Gandhi, aimed at boycotting British institutions, including educational institutions and government services. It began in 1920, but the return of war medals was specifically related to the Khilafat Movement.\nOption D: The Champaran Satyagraha was one of Gandhi's early movements in India against the exploitation of indigo farmers in Champaran, Bihar. The return of war medals was not associated with this movement.\nTherefore, the correct option is Option C: in support of the Khilafat demand when the Central Khilafat Committee organised a general all-India hartal on August 1, 1920, as Mahatma Gandhi returned the war medals and gave up the title of Kaiser-i-Hind as part of his support for the Khilafat Movement."
