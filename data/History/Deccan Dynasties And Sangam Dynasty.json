            "Sopara",
            "Ellora",

        "correct_answer": "b",
        "note": "Since most of the Rashtrakutas monuments are found at Ellora, with nothing correspondence at Malkhed (Manyakher), it has been suggested that the early capital was located in the vicinity of the Ellora caves in the time of Dantidurga who was the founder and first ruler of the dynasty."
