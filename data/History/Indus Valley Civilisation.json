        ],
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "note": "Correct Answer: Option B — Stones, trees and animals\nWhat the archaeological record from the Indus Valley shows\nExcavations at major Indus sites (such as Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, Kalibangan, and others) have yielded abundant evidence of nature-centred cults.\nSeals and amulets frequently depict animals—most notably the humped bull, but also tigers, elephants, rhinoceroses, and the famous “unicorn” motif—indicating reverence, totemic value, or protective power associated with animals.\nSeveral seals and terracottas represent sacred trees (especially the pipal/peepal), sometimes with a worshipper or a deity-figure beneath or within the tree, pointing to arboreal cults.\nAcross settlements, excavators also report aniconic/stone objects used in ritual contexts (e.g., stones and small altars/platforms), consistent with treating select stones as sacred. While individual interpretations vary, the recurring presence of such objects supports the idea that stones themselves could function as revered, consecrated symbols rather than merely building materials.\nHow this links organically to Hinduism today\nLater Hindu practice preserves a strong continuity of nature worship: veneration of sacred trees (pipal, banyan), ritual and festival honouring of animals (e.g., the bull Nandi associated with Shiva; the serpent in Nāga worship; the cow’s ritual sanctity), and widespread aniconic stone worship (naturally found or river-worn stones set up as village deities; consecrated stones like the śālagrāma in Vaiṣṇava traditions).\nBecause these practices are broad, persistent, and deeply rooted, they form a clear cultural bridge from the Indus era’s nature-centric symbols to living Hindu traditions.\nWhy the other options are weaker\nOption A (Pashupati, Indra and the Mother Goddess): A “proto-Pashupati” figure and Mother Goddess figurines are indeed cited from Indus contexts; however, Indra is a Vedic deity without secure archaeological attestation in the IVC, weakening this option’s internal consistency.\nOption C (Vishnu and Lakshmi): There is no definitive Indus evidence for the worship of these specific deities; associating them with IVC rests on much later textual traditions, not on Indus finds.\nOption D (Siva and Sakti): Readings of a proto-Śiva (Pashupati-like) seal and the divine feminine are plausible but interpretative. Even if partially valid, this pair does not capture the wider, well-documented nature cult that best demonstrates continuity.\nConclusion — Why Option B is correct\nThe most secure, excavation-based through-line from the Indus Valley to modern Hinduism is the widespread veneration of elements of nature: stones, trees, and animals. This pattern is abundantly evidenced in Indus material culture and remains pervasive in Hindu practice. Therefore, when only one choice must be selected, Option B most convincingly demonstrates the organic relationship between the two."

A large number of seals have been found at the port of Lothal in western India. Finds of Mesopotamian weights in Indus Valley cities confirm that trading took place between these two civilisations.

On the other hand, there is nothing to suggest that people from Mesopotamia reached the Indus, so it is clear that the Harappans conducted the trade between the two civilizations. Mesopotamian ships sailed the length of the Gulf, as far as the western coast of Magan (Oman peninsula), trading directly with Magan and with Dilmun (Bahrain); ships from Magan and Dilmun also docked in Mesopotamian ports."

Each house had its own drainage and soak pit which was connected to the public drainage. Brick laid channels flowed through every street.

Thus Indus people had a perfect underground drainage system. No other contemporary civilization gave so much attention to cleanliness."
