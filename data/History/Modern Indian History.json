His leadership during this period was marked by his commitment to the ideals of democracy, secularism, and social justice. He worked closely with other prominent leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad to steer the country towards independence.\n\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, Kripalani continued to be actively involved in politics and social reform. He served as a member of the Constituent Assembly of India, where he contributed to the drafting of the Indian Constitution. He also held various ministerial positions in independent India.\n\nOverall, J. B.

It aimed to bring the Company under greater control by the British government.\n\n*   Why not the other options?\n    *   White Paper: A White Paper is usually a document presenting a government's policy or proposals on a particular issue. The Pitts India Act was a law, not just a policy statement.\n    *   Ordinance: An Ordinance is usually a law promulgated by a local governing body or, in some contexts, by an executive authority when the legislature is not in session. The Pitts India Act was an act of the British Parliament.\n    *   Resolution: A Resolution is a formal expression of opinion or intention made usually after voting. The Pitts India Act was a binding law.\n\n*   In simple terms:\n    Think of it like this: The British government felt the East India Company was getting too powerful and needed to be managed. The Pitts India Act was like a set of new rules and controls to manage the Company's affairs. Therefore, it's a Regulating Act."
