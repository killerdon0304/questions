It was a large-scale rebellion against the British East India Company.\nThe question asks who began this rebellion. Let's look at the options:\nOption A: The sepoys – Sepoys were Indian soldiers who served in the British East India Company's army.\nOption B: The zamindars – Zamindars were landlords who collected taxes for the British.\nOption C: The peasants – Peasants were farmers who worked the land.\nOption D: The plantation workers – Plantation workers were laborers who worked on large farms, often owned by the British.\nWhile many groups participated in the Revolt of 1857,  it primarily began with the sepoys.  The immediate cause was the introduction of new rifle cartridges greased with animal fat (pork and beef), which offended both Hindu and Muslim soldiers. This sparked widespread anger and mutiny within the sepoy ranks, leading to the wider rebellion.\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option A: The sepoys.  Although other groups joined the revolt later, the initial spark came from the sepoys' rebellion against the British."

With these developments, the second phase of the Civil Disobedience Movement came to an end. The  constructive  programme  may  otherwise  and  more  fittingly  be  called construction  of  Poorna  Swaraj or complete independence by truthful and nonviolent means. Effort  for  construction  of  Independence  so  called  through  violent  and, therefore,  necessarily  untruthful  means  we  know  only  too  painfully.  Look  at  the daily  destruction  of  property,  life  and  truth  in  the  present  war. Complete  Independence  through  truth  and  non-violence  means  the independence  of  every  unit,  be  it  the  humblest  of  the  nation,  without distinction  of  race,  colour  or  creed."

The march covered a distance of about 240 miles (386 kilometers) over 24 days. At Dandi, Gandhi violated the British salt laws by picking up a lump of salt from the seashore, symbolizing the defiance of British rule.\nThe Dandi March and the Civil Disobedience Movement marked a turning point in India's struggle for independence, with people across the country participating in acts of civil disobedience, boycotting British goods, and engaging in protest activities.\nOption A: Sabarmati Ashram was Gandhi's residence and a center for his activities, but the Civil Disobedience Movement was launched from Dandi.\nOption B: Ahmedabad is a city in Gujarat where Gandhi had a significant presence, but the movement was initiated from Dandi.\nOption C: Porbandar is Gandhi's birthplace, but the Civil Disobedience Movement did not begin there.\nTherefore, the correct option is Option D: Dandi, where Mahatma Gandhi launched the Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930 with the historic Dandi March."

The Non-Cooperation Movement was a significant phase of India's struggle for independence, led by Mahatma Gandhi and supported by various Indian political and social groups.\nDuring the Non-Cooperation Movement, Indians boycotted British institutions, including schools, colleges, law courts, and government services, as a form of nonviolent protest against British colonial rule. The movement aimed to bring the British government to the negotiating table and gain concessions related to India's political rights and self-governance.\nOne of the positive outcomes of the movement was the increased cooperation and unity between Hindus and Muslims. The movement saw Hindus and Muslims participating together in large numbers, demonstrating a shared commitment to the cause of India's independence. This unity was significant as it indicated the potential for harmony and collaboration among diverse communities in the pursuit of common goals.\nOption A: The Non-Cooperation Movement did express solidarity with the Khilafat Movement, but its primary focus was on Indian grievances against British rule rather than directly stopping the injustice done to the Khilafat.\nOption B: While the movement did contribute to Indian political awareness and rights, its major impact was in fostering unity and a shared sense of purpose among Indians.\nOption D: The Non-Cooperation Movement did not specifically avenge the Punjab atrocities; however, it did address broader issues related to British rule in India.\nTherefore, the correct option is Option C: The Hindus and the Muslims came closer in political pursuit, as one of the achieved milestones of the Non-Cooperation Movement of 1921 was the increased unity and cooperation between Hindus and Muslims in India's struggle for independence."
