        ],
        "correct_answer": "a",
        "note": "The statement \"The force between two objects is always equal and opposite\" refers to Newton's third law of motion. This law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In other words, when one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts a force of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction on the first object.\n\nOption B: Second law of motion\nNewton's second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. This law does not specifically address the concept of equal and opposite forces between two objects.\n\nOption C: First and second law of motion\nWhile both the first and second laws of motion are fundamental principles in classical mechanics, neither of them directly addresses the idea of forces being equal and opposite between two objects.\n\nOption D: First law of motion\nNewton's first law of motion, also known as the law of inertia, states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will remain in motion with the same velocity unless acted upon by an external force. This law does not directly address the concept of equal and opposite forces between two objects.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option A: Third law of motion."
